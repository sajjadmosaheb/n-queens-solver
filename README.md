# N-Queens Problem Visualizer

This project is a web-based visualizer for the N-Queens problem, built with Next.js and React. It allows users to explore different solutions to the N-Queens problem for a given board size (N). The primary focus is on visualizing valid configurations of queens on the chessboard.

## What is the N-Queens Problem?

The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle in computer science and mathematics. The goal is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Features (Based on File Analysis)

- **Interactive Chessboard Visualization:** Displays the N×N chessboard with placed queens.
- **Solution Display:** Shows different valid configurations of queens on the board.
- **Controls:** Provides options to likely adjust the board size (N) and potentially trigger the generation or visualization of solutions.
- **Shadcn UI Components:** Utilizes a set of pre-built UI components for a clean and modern look.
